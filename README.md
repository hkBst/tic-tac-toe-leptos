# tic-tac-toe-leptos
This is an extremely minimal [tic-tac-toe](https://github.com/hkBst/tic-tac-toe) webUI using [leptos](https://github.com/leptos-rs/leptos), for comparison with other Rust front-end frameworks.

## how to use
Leptos works fine with [trunk](https://github.com/thedodd/trunk), so install that: `cargo install trunk`.

Use `trunk serve` when developing and `trunk build --release` when deploying.
